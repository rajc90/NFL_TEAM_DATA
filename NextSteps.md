Idea: 
Comapare pure offensive and defensive stats to win amount
- break up by division (creat a reference table)
- Put stats into sklearn ml model to determine what are most important factors (yards/tds)
- calculate total offensive/defensive tds scored/allowed

Data Cleaning
- Team name updates like the Washington Football Team


Todo:
- Comment out the pulling downs data.
- Configure defensive stats to also pull in data correctly
- adjust column names to specify type (pass/rush) and side (offensive/defensive)
- look into a way to store the data. (SQL, Google Big query)
